    <img src="../images/Lasagna.jpeg">

    <p>Lasagna is the perfect meal, and of all of the recipes I've tried over the years, <em>this</em> is the perfect lasagna!</p>
    <p>Lasagna is a staple for busy school nights becasue it keeps, reheats, and freezes so well and it's nice ot have something in the fridge to enjoy throughout the week.</p>
    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>

    <!--Unordered list to display ingreadiants-->
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ground Beef</strong> - We used 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for juicier lasagna.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion</strong> - We use yellow onion, or sweet onion works well</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic Cloves</strong> - you can add more if you love garlic</li>
        <li><strong>Red Wine (or beef broth)</strong> - This amps up the flavor of your sauce (avoid using cooking wine).</li>
        <li><strong>Marinara Sauce</strong> - Use homemade marinara or store-bought</li>
        <li><strong>Dried Thyme</strong> - Italian seasoning, basil, or oregano can be substituted</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong> - Balances the acidity of the tomatoes</li>
        <li><strong>Parsley</strong> - flat-leaf or curly parsley works well</li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna Noodles</strong> - Cook these al dente; they'll continue to soften as the lasagna bakes</li>
        <li><strong>Cottage Cheese</strong> - adds great texture and moisture</li>
        <li><strong>Ricotta Cheese</strong> - We use low-fat or part0skim ricotta</li>
        <li><strong>Mozzarella Cheese</strong> - An Italian cheese blend works, but mozzarella is definitely the classic top choice</li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong> - Helps hold the cheese layer together</li>

        
    </ul>
